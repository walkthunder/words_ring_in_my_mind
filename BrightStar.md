#Bright Star
-- John Keats

Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art

Not in lone splendour hung aloft in night and watching

With eternal lids apart

Like nature's patient, sleepless eremite

The moving waters as their priestlike task of pure ablution round earth's human shores

Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask of snow upon the mountains and the moors

No, yet still stedfast, still unchangeable

Pillow'd upon my fair lover's ripening breast

To feel for ever its soft fall and swell

Awake forever in a sweet unrest

Still, still to here her tender-taken breath

and so live ever

Or else swooned to death
